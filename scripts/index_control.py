## @package index_control
# Documentation for file index_control.py
#
# This ROS node (developed for testing purposes) reads messages from 'skeleton_topic'.
# As soon at it receives them,
# it isolates the 3 joints currespundant to the index finger and calculates
# the degree of flexion/extension of the finger itself. Then, it
# publishes on the 'serial_publisher' topic the commands
# needed to control the robotic actuator, to let it assume the
# desired shape for what concern the index finger.
