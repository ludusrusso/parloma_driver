# For a possible future, but this feature is not implemented yet
The service as soon as receives from the client node 
the sentence will convert each letter to the upper case
and then transposes letter by letter in the corrispondent
in Morse code. In addition to letters and numbers 
it is possible to convert also some symbols. 
The Morse code is executed with both the Buzzer
and a led.
